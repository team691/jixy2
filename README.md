# jixy2

A Java library for the Pixy2 vision-processing camera.

Developed initially for use in FIRST FRC robot programs,
but possible to be extended to other platforms by way of
the DeviceLink interface, where platform-specific code
for sending and receiving data to and from the Pixy2
device should be included in a class implementing
DeviceLink.
